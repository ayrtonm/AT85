This repo contains random snippets of code for the attiny85. It currently contains code for using the ADC, Timers, and interfacing with an ssd1306 OLED driver.
-ADC: reads voltage on pin PB2 and returns 10-bit result. Set to free running mode(no interrupts necessary). Prescaler set to 8 so at 1MHz ck is 125kHz. read_vcc measures Vbg using Vcc as Vref, this is much more accurate and simpler than taking two measurements like before
-Timers: sets Timer1 and register A so interrupts occur about once per second (1.00057633 Hz exactly)
-OLED: code based off of https://bitbucket.org/tinusaur/ssd1306xled
  -planning on modifying oled_string_8x16 and oled_num_8x16 to not need x,y values
