This repo contains random snippets of code for the attiny85. It currently contains code for using the ADC, Timers, and interfacing with an ssd1306 OLED driver.
-ADC: reads voltage on pin PB2 and returns 10-bit result. Set to free running mode(no interrupts necessary). Prescaler set to 8 so at 1MHz ck is 125kHz. read_vcc takes two measurements on ADC4 (temp sensor) and returns vcc * 1000
-Timers: sets Timer1 and register A so interrupts occur about once per second (1.00057633 Hz exactly)
-OLED: code based off of https://bitbucket.org/tinusaur/ssd1306xled
  -planning on modifying oled_string_8x16 and oled_num_8x16 to not need x,y values
-UI: planning on adding user interface
  -screen for plotting value
  -screen for displaying time
  -connect resistor ladder to ADC for buttons
    -resistor values are 10k to vcc, 10k to sw1, 20k to sw2, 39k to sw3
    -sw2 currently has 2 10k resistors, I should get some 20k instead
    -adc should read the following values
    sw1 sw2 sw3 adc
    0   0   0   1023
    0   0   1   818
    0   1   0   683-688
    0   1   1   586
    1   0   0   512-513
    1   0   1   454-455
    1   1   0   409-410
    1   1   1   371-372
    the following values are halfway between each consecutive adc reading and are used for determining which buttons are pressed
